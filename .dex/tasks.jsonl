However, several Governor features are underutilized that could improve behavior against GitHub's API rate limits.\n\n## Current State\n\n- Uses `RateLimiter::direct(Quota::per_second(10))` for all operations\n- No burst configuration (implicit burst = 1)\n- Single rate limiter for both read and write operations\n- No jitter when multiple concurrent tasks compete\n\n## Recommended Improvements\n\n### 1. Configure Burst Tolerance\nGitHub allows bursts - configure Governor to match:\n```rust\nlet quota = Quota::per_second(nonzero!(10u32))\n    .allow_burst(nonzero!(20u32));\n```\n\n### 2. Separate Read/Write Limiters\nWrite operations (starring) trigger secondary rate limits more easily:\n```rust\npub struct GitHubRateLimiter {\n    read: Arc<GovernorRateLimiter>,   // 10 req/sec, burst 20\n    write: Arc<GovernorRateLimiter>,  // 3 req/sec, burst 5\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add Jitter for Concurrent Operations\nPrevent thundering herd when multiple tasks hit the limiter:\n```rust\nlet jitter = Jitter::up_to(Duration::from_millis(50));\nself.inner.until_ready_with_jitter(jitter).await;\n```\n\n### 4. Consider Keyed Limiter for Per-Endpoint Limits\nDifferent endpoints may have different rate limit characteristics.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `crates/curator/src/platform.rs` - ApiRateLimiter implementation\n- `crates/curator/src/sync/engine.rs` - Rate limiter usage in sync operations\n\n## References\n\n- Governor docs: https://docs.rs/governor/latest/governor/\n- GCRA algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_cell_rate_algorithm\n- GitHub rate limits: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/rate-limit\n\nBeads close reason:\nAbsorbed into curator-soc \u2014 Governor replaced by custom adaptive GCRA","priority":2,"completed":true,"result":"Migrated from Beads (status: closed).\n\nBeads close reason:\nAbsorbed into curator-soc \u2014 Governor replaced by custom adaptive GCRA\n\nClosed at: 2026-02-07T01:13:18.722599-08:00","metadata":null,"created_at":"2026-02-13T20:02:27.164Z","updated_at":"2026-02-13T20:03:09.101Z","started_at":"2026-02-13T20:03:09.098Z","completed_at":"2026-02-13T20:03:09.101Z","blockedBy":[],"blocks":[],"children":[]}

Fetch completes last API pages, sends final repos to `repo_tx`\n2. Processor receives repos, filters them, sends to `model_tx` via blocking `.await` (engine.rs:703)\n3. Persist task batches items and only flushes when batch=100 OR channel closed (shared.rs:185)\n4. Deadlock forms when:\n   - Persist has partial batch waiting for more items\n   - `model_tx` fills (100 items) \u2192 processor blocks\n   - `repo_tx` fills (100 items) \u2192 fetch blocks\n   - Fetch can't complete \u2192 channels never close \u2192 persist never flushes final batch\n\n## Key Files\n\n- `crates/curator/src/sync/engine.rs:636-875` - `sync_starred_streaming`\n- `crates/curator_cli/src/commands/shared.rs:147-200` - persist task loop\n- `crates/curator/src/github/client.rs:1276-1573` - `list_starred_repos_streaming`\n\n## Proposed Fixes\n\n1. Add timeout to processor channel sends (don't block indefinitely)\n2. Add time-based flushing to persist task (don't wait only for full batches)\n3. Increase channel buffer sizes (reduce backpressure likelihood)\n4. Add watchdog timeout in select loop to detect hangs\n\nBeads close reason:\nFixed by implementing time-based flushing in persist task and increasing channel buffer sizes","priority":2,"completed":true,"result":"Migrated from Beads (status: closed).\n\nBeads close reason:\nFixed by implementing time-based flushing in persist task and increasing channel buffer sizes\n\nClosed at: 2026-01-23T13:10:29.092922-08:00","metadata":null,"created_at":"2026-02-13T20:02:54.951Z","updated_at":"2026-02-13T20:03:32.387Z","started_at":"2026-02-13T20:03:32.384Z","completed_at":"2026-02-13T20:03:32.387Z","blockedBy":[],"blocks":[],"children":[]}
